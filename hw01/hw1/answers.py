**Your answer:**
'''
Increasing k will not lead to improve generalization, in general.
For the extermal value 1 - each sample will be classified according to the one closest sample in the training set, in this case there will be errors because the closest sample in the training set doens't always have the correct prediction.
For the extermal value of the size of the training set, each sample will be labled according to all the samples in the training set, therefore each sample will be classified the same, in this case it is clear we will have many errors.
Therefore, we would like to increase k up to the point it gives enough options for the data to be labeled, but not to get too far away from the closest sample.
